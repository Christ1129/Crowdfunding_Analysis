# Crowdfunding_Analysis

Crowdfunding highlights certain projects via data. On this basis, some conclusions can be drawn:
1.	Crowdfunding data shows that the percentage of successful campaigns is usually higher than the percentage of failures. The following graph inserted in sheet 3 illustrates this assertion well. A peak of successful campaigns can also be observed between June and July. We may also see an insignificant cancellation rate in this graph

2.	Despite a trend of successful campaigns, there is a decrease in successful campaigns (37%) versus failures (57%) when the goal exceeds 50,000. This may also reflect the platform's limit to goals successful out of 50,000

3.	 based on the calculated results (variance & Std) there are more variability with the successful campaigns. 
		
### Limitations of this dataset

   For better analysis, data from previous campaigns would be useful. That said, we could come to better conclusions if we could analyze and compare data from previous years for this platform.

Other graphs could help to better refine the analysis:

-The pie chart for example could better represent the percentage ratio of the variables (success, failed and canceled)

-We could also study the correlation between the objective and the variables (goal/success/failure). It would be a good idea to try the Granger causality test (between Goal/successful/failed/country). 
Overall, graphs reporting Crowdfunding data show a higher rate of successful campaigns compared to failed campaigns. For better economic and financial profitability in the future, crowdfunding should reduce the failure rate of campaign
